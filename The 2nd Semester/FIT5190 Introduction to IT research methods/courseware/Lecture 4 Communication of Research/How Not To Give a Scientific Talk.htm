  <i>Not</i> To Give a Scientific Talk </font></font></b></h1>

<p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Michael De Robertis</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The importance of communicating well 
  is often underplayed in science in general and in astronomy in particular. Yet 
  the need to communicate clearly and concisely in science is at least as acute 
  as in the humanities and social sciences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have all experienced scientific 
  talks that have been both stimulating and memorable. Unfortunately, most talks 
  - talks at all levels ï¿½ are by no means in this category!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are the secrets of giving a 
  good oral presentation, of giving a memorable talk? The answer to this question 
  is beyond the scope of this article. To be truthful, I don't know the answer. 
  But having attended hundreds of oral presentations over the past twenty years, 
  I think I have some appreciation of the characteristics that lead to a <i>poor</i> 
  scientific oral presentation, characteristics that I share below. The following 
  provides an enumeration of <i>how not to give a scientific talk</i>. These are 
  largely based on an excellent article by J.C. Garland (<i>Physics Today</i>, <b>44</b>, p. 42) and are supplemented by my own 
  observations that reflect my particular biases.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Violate the three cardinal 
  rules</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To violate any of the three cardinal 
  rules of giving a good scientific talk is to court disaster and to risk being 
  consigned to immediate oblivion by your audience! But if ignominy is your goal, 
  then I recommend that you:</font></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exceed the allotted time</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Never practise beforehand</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Never be prepared for a total 
      failure of modern technology</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as successful or memorable oral 
  scientific presentations <i>are</i> practised beforehand, disastrous talks <i>are 
  almost never</i> practised prior to their delivery. This is surely the strongest 
  correlation of all. The reason that the quality of oral presentations (inevitably 
  in English) at international meetings is higher by Europeans than by North Americans 
  in my view is evidence that practising one's talk is the surest way of enhancing 
  its quality and ensuring its successful reception.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a talk has never been practised, 
  the odds of exceeding one's allotted time increase dramatically, and nothing 
  annoys an audience more than a speaker who goes overtime. This is the one "capital 
  crime" of scientific presentations. Neophytes to the subject and experts alike 
  ignore almost everything presented during "overtime," and the longer one proceeds, 
  the more ill will one generates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third point may not be as common 
  as the first two, but there are rare occasions when speakers are only prepared 
  to deliver a talk in one format; e.g., PowerPoint, and are totally incapacitated 
  when there is a failure of modern technology, e.g., the projector isn't delivered 
  on time, or your laptop isn't quite compatible with the projector, or... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Put another way, if you forget that 
  <i>an oral presentation is really a reflection of you,</i> then you are almost 
  certainly doomed to give an inferior talk.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp; </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the above may constitute "mortal 
  sins" in the arena of scientific oral presentations, there are many more "venial 
  sins" that are committed by presenters, flaws that detract from the overall 
  quality of the presentation. I've loosely arranged these "sins" into a few categories. 
  The order in each category is unimportant.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Deportment</b></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wear clothing that distracts from 
    your science</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wear clothing that doesn't permit 
    easily attaching a portable microphone</font></li>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neither women nor men should wear 
  anything that could distract audience members from your principal goal of effectively 
  communicating your science. This includes wearing revealing clothing, or dressing 
  too formally or too informally for the situation. Women and men should also 
  take care to wear clothing to which a portable microphone can be easily attached. 
  At large meetings, the chair of the session sometimes (helpfully) tries to attach 
  the microphone to the speaker's clothing. If you are uncomfortable with this 
  protocol for any reason, simply make it apparent that you will attach the microphone 
  yourself when it comes your turn.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<ol>
  <ol>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuously wander around the 
      room</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jingle change in your pocket</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overdo the use of hand gestures</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Act nervous and confused; ramble 
      incoherently</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Avoid making eye contact with 
      the audience</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overdo the use of humour</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Face the screen, often blocking 
      the view of the projector</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speak in a muffled fashion with 
      an irregular cadence</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Raise the pitch of your voice 
      at the end of sentences</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Place a clip-on microphone on 
      the wrong side of your shirt/top</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuously wave your laser pointer on the screen making the audience nauseous </font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> 
</p><p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Few things are more annoying than 
  when speakers display nervous mannerisms that distract some audience members 
  from concentrating on the science at hand. For example, it is imprudent to wander 
  randomly about the speaking area, of using exaggerated gestures, of using jokes 
  or humour unsuccessfully, of failing to make eye contact with (at least certain 
  members of) the audience, of speaking incoherently, of reading from the screen 
  and turning your back on the audience for extended periods, etc. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While it is not inappropriate in 
  the context of a scientific oral presentation to prepare some notes from which 
  to speak, it is inappropriate to read the talk verbatim, either from the notes 
  or the screen. And please ensure that the microphone is clipped on the side 
  of your shirt/top that will be closest to the screen so that your voice doesn't 
  fade out when drawing attention to something on the screen. Take care not to 
  present in too bold a fashion - science doesn't admit absolute certainty - or 
  too tentative a manner. With regard to the latter point, I've noticed that some 
  inexperienced speakers sometimes raise the pitch of their voices at the end 
  of some sentences thereby unintentionally reducing their effectiveness with 
  the audience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Level of Talk</b></font></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Make the talk either too technical 
      or too simple</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use equations profusely and 
      gratuitously</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is essential that one accurately 
  gauge the nature and level of the audience beforehand and tailor one's presentation 
  appropriately. For an audience with mixed familiarity with your subject, one 
  might devote most of the talk to an introduction to your subject and of a careful 
  articulation of your incremental contribution(s). Use the last 10-20 percent 
  of the time to speak to the experts in the audience, but ensure that the conclusion 
  or summary is delivered at the introductory level. In this way, your presentation 
  may indeed be memorable! It goes without saying that gratuitous displays of 
  math or highly technical information are normally off-putting and should be 
  avoided.</font></p>
<u>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Written Material</b></font></p>
</u> 
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't include a clear and concise 
      summary slide of results </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't leave the audience with 
      a clear understanding of your most memorable finding</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ensure transparencies are illegible, 
      densely packed, monochromatic, or a rainbow of colours</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use too many irrelevant animations 
      in PowerPoint presentations, or colour schemes that render text illegible</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use modern technology to add 
      "sizzle" rather than "steak"</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On average, use more than one 
      transparency or slide every two minutes</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adopt the "strip-tease" approach 
      to showing transparencies</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For very short contributed presentations 
  (10-15 minutes), it is often most effective if one shows a clear and concise 
  summary of your results both at the outset and conclusion of your talk. Use 
  the remaining time to essentially fill in the details. Even for longer talks 
  (30-60 minutes), it is a good idea to leave the audience with a clear impression 
  of what you have accomplished. Nothing is more satisfying than to have explained 
  a difficult concept to the audience in a way that they will recall for some 
  time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are obvious pitfalls for speakers 
  who employ high tech means of delivering an oral presentation. Just because 
  technology routinely permits the introduction of animations, multi-coloured 
  text, etc., that doesn't mean you should automatically employ these techniques 
  <i>unless they illustrate in a clearer way an important concept</i>. In other 
  words, unless you can add "steak" to the presentation by adopting high-tech 
  methods, avoid them. Don't settle for just "sizzle."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In science, clarity and depth of 
  understanding are paramount. The slide or overhead acts as a mere vehicle for 
  the speaker to convey a profound point, or a new or different way of looking 
  at a problem. It may therefore be counterproductive to show too much information 
  or to show it in a halting way. Common sense should prevail, but "less" is better 
  than "more" in oral presentations.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Answering Questions</b></font></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Always argue with a questioner; 
      provoke a fight</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Always interrupt a questioner 
      before he/she has finished asking the question</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drag your answer out for as 
      long as possible to show off</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fake it if you don't know the 
      answer</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't give credit to anyone 
      else's work and don't admit the questioner may be raising an important issue</font></li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The answer period constitutes an 
  important component of a scientific oral presentation. Science works ultimately 
  by challenging prevailing ideas, even your ideas! Coming at the end of a presentation, 
  the question period will unavoidably colour how most audience members remember 
  you and your science. It is therefore important that you adhere to a code of 
  common sense and basic civility. By all means, enthusiastically recapitulate, 
  expound and defend your science, but at the same time, be courteous, brief, 
  admit unfamiliarity or ignorance of some point(s), and offer to discuss more 
  esoteric or deeper issues "offline."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In summary, I have tried to enumerate 
  various pitfalls that scientific speakers encounter when giving an oral presentation. 
  I think it is important that effective communication skills form an integral 
  part of undergraduate and graduate training. In lieu of a formal course in these 
  techniques, perhaps lists such as this one, in conjunction with frequent opportunities 
  to practice (e.g., journal clubs, senior seminars, etc.), could be used. This 
  list is by no means complete and I welcome additions/comments from colleagues 
  (mmdr@yorku.ca).</font></p>
